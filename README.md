Source code to Apple ][ Crisis Mountain Game - Found circa 1985ish on the Crisis Mountain game disk as two deleted files

Back in the day I used to run a utility called LifeSaver on all the disks I had just to see what it could come up with.  The LifeSaver utility would scan floppy disks for deleted files.  It would typically find the track sector list and create a pointer to the file in the catalog.

Sometimes it would find cool stuff (i.e. these files) and sometimes it would just find junk.  I remember using it on Dino Eggs in order to find the sprite file which ended up just being hires images that I could then modify and make Dino Eggs look the way I wanted it to.

But I digress.... I never tried compiling these to see if they actually work, I'm just dumping here for future generations.

I have no right to these files, if the copyright owner asks I will remove them.

I'm dropping them here as DOS txt files that I converted from Apple DOS 3.3 Disk .S files using CiderPress.
